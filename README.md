- 👋 Hi, I’m @CCheimak inviting you to share this essential quest:
- 💞️ We strongly believe in enabling people to meet and converse remotely without hesitation. The internet offers an ideal platform for this purpose. However, many individuals feel intimidated by video, which becomes a significant barrier to effective communication. The initial prejudice of "first impressions" poses a challenge. Hence, it is imperative for us to develop a secure environment where we can engage in **extensive voice-based communication** before transitioning to visual interactions.
- 👀 Join us in developing a PWA (Progressive web Application) site that everyone can talk to each other (or to many others) on a serverless (MySql based) peer-to-peer connection.
- 🌱 We have developed a working version which needs a lot of improvement: it works reasonably well one-to-one, but it needs much improvement and also offer a "many-people-can-talk" version everybody can enjoy (interest-groups, broadcast-your-own-radio, communities, discussion-groups, you name it) ; join us to make this possible for the good of all (we plan on using a GNU Affero General Public License - approach).
- 📫 Please reach out first by email at info@FriendsToTalkTo.org
