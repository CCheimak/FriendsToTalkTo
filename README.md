- 👋 Hi, I’m @CCheimak
- I firmly believe people should be able to meet and talk remotely with no fear, and web is perfect for that, but many people are intimidated by video, and that is one of the major problems in communication: the initial prejudice of "first impressions". We need to develop a safe environment where people can communicate extensively via voice BEFORE chancing to see others. 
- 👀 I’m interested in further developing a set of simple JQuery/CSS/PHP/MySQL/WebRTC web pages I've built so that people (anyone/everyone) can add to their sites such that everyone can talk to each other (or to many others) on a serverless (MySql based) peer-to-peer connection.
- 🌱 I have developed a working version which needs a lot of improvement: it works reasonably well one-to-one, but I'd love to offer a "many-people-can-talk" version everybody can enjoy (interest-groups, broadcast-your-own-radio, communities, discussion-groups, you name it) ; would you like to help make this possible for the good of all (GNU Affero General Public License - like)?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on this with everybody interested just for the good of all, so that all people can talk safely——whereas in group conversation, clubhouse-like way or on a private voice/video conference in a zoom-like or skype-like fashion... but different.
- 📫 How to reach me: please reach me first by email at info@OpenGroupTalk.org
